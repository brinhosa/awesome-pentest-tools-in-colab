# awesome-pentest-tools-in-colab
A curated list of awesome Penetration Testing and DevSecOps Tools ported to Google Colab to make faster and easier to try, execute and test.

Google Colab, ‚ÄúColab‚Äù for short, is a product from Google Research. Colab allows anybody to write and execute arbitrary python code through the browser, and is especially well suited to machine learning, data analysis, education and now security. More technically, Colab is a hosted Jupyter notebook service that requires no setup to use, while providing free access to computing resources including GPUs.
Colab allows you to write and execute Python, Bash and Linux tools in your browser, with: 
- Zero configuration required
- Free access to GPUs
- Easy sharing
- Easily execute new Security Tools

Open the Google Colab link, copy the commands or use it with your own run-time (https://research.google.com/colaboratory/local-runtimes.html) and execute the tools against your own code or running environment.
